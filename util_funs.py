""" This section contains two different versions/ways to measure the
    execution time of functions or code snippits.    
    
    1. CUSTOM DECODER
    The most flexible and industry-standard way to time a Python function 
    is by using a decorator with time.perf_counter(). This method provides 
    the highest precision for measuring execution time and allows you to 
    reuse the timing logic across multiple functions without modifying their 
    core code. This approach measures the CPU usage time of the function. 
    See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FblABqaKz_U), or 
     (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TfccynZoF-c), or
    (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14452145/how-to-measure-time-taken-between-lines-of-code-in-python)
    
    2. BUILT-IN timeit MODULE 
    If you need to benchmark a small code block or a quick function snippet 
    repeatedly to account for system fluctuations, the built-in timeit module 
    is ideal. This measures the wallclock execution time of a function, which 
    may not be exactly the same as the CPU execution time.
    See (https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html), or 
        (https://pymotw.com/3/timeit/)
